This adaptor was quickly modelled up in Fusion 360 
to allow a disposable vape I got from the recycle bin of a local vape shop
to act as a self contained smoke generator
I removed the foam wicking material, squeezed out all the vape liquid
and then refilled it with heavy-fog smoke machine fluid so there is no nicotine
Feel free to use.
